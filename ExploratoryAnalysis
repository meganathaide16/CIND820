#1. Read in data -----

#2. Briefly examine the data -----
# First I will take a look at the types of variables included in the dataset
str(df)
# Taking a look at the output of the str function, I can see that there are a few changes to make to edit the datatypes to make it easier to work with.
# i. Date should be changed from character to date data type 
# ii. The seasons, holiday and functioning day variables should be changed to factor data type
df$Date <- as.Date(df$Date,"%d/%m/%Y")
df$Seasons <- as.factor(df$Seasons)
df$Holiday <- as.factor(df$Holiday)
df$`Functioning Day` <- as.factor(df$`Functioning Day`)
#let's take a look at the data types now
